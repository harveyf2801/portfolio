                                <!-- I am an enthusiastic and dedicated engineering undergraduate who is looking to expand upon current software engineering skills. -->
                                I started my journey as a musician, playing the guitar, keyboard, and trombone. As my interest in coding grew, I envisioned blending my technical skills with the world of audio. That curiosity led me to enrol on the Sound Engineering course at Birmingham City University, where my exploration at the intersection of technology and sound truly took off.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout my time at university, I dived into a mix of projects – from crafting audio effects and synthesisers, to designing recording studios and organising festival events. This fusion of musical flair and programming know-how allowed me to sculpt sonic experiences in unique and exciting ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along the way, I ventured into the realm of machine learning, working on projects involving audio classification, black-box modelling and reinforcement learning.

                                Currently I’m working as a Junior Software Engineer at Audient. This role invlolves development of UI and control application for our products, along with bug fixing and implementong new features. Some projects I have worked on includes the integration of EUCON and StreamDeck control within our ORIA product range.

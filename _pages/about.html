                                <!-- I am an enthusiastic and dedicated engineering undergraduate who is looking to expand upon current software engineering skills. -->
                                I started my journey as a musician, playing the guitar, keyboard, and trombone. As my interest in coding grew, I envisioned blending my technical skills with the world of audio. That curiosity led me to enrol on the Sound Engineering course at Birmingham City University, where my exploration at the intersection of technology and sound truly took off.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout my time at university, I dived into a mix of projects – from crafting audio effects and synthesisers, to designing recording studios and organising festival events. This fusion of musical flair and programming know-how allowed me to sculpt sonic experiences in unique and exciting ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along the way, I ventured into the realm of machine learning, working on projects involving audio classification, black-box modelling and reinforcement learning.

                                Currently I’m studying my 3rd year of Sound Engineering and Production at Birmingham City University. During this time I am also working part time as a visiting demonstrator teaching audio software development.

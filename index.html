                        With <script>document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 2020);</script> years of academic and industry led programming experience, I've honed my skills across diverse projects, ranging from audio software products to test automation, as well as web and app designs.

                    <p>
                        My academic pursuits have delved into the realm of Machine Learning, where I've actively applied my knowledge in audio classification, beat tracking and black box modelling within university projects.
